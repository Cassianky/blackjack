# BlackJack

# Purpose

As an amateur gambler with poor luck, I ended up losing around $15 playing blackjack during Chinese New Year 2025.

As a sore loser, I wrote this simple script based on specific Singaporean blackjack CNY game rules to calculate the probabilities of winning as a player and as a dealer.

# Future plans

I aim to develop this script into an application that suggests the optimal next move based on perfect strategy to maximize CNY blackjack earnings.

# Progress

Not a current priority. Work in progress.

# Note

Warning: This script wonâ€™t turn you into a high-roller, but it might help you lose money more efficiently. Proceed with caution and a sense of humor!
